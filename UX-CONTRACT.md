# IBPA Admin UX Contract

## Product context

- **Audience:** IBPA staff operating editorial, membership, communications, and recorded-media workflows.
- **Primary job:** Find a managed record, understand its lifecycle state, complete one clear action, and recover safely from provider or network failures.
- **Locale:** The admin interface is English (`en-US`). Managed content may be Russian, English, or Ukrainian.
- **Time policy:** Stored instants are UTC. Date-only filters are sent as ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`; the browser owns the compact native calendar popup.
- **Accessibility target:** WCAG 2.2 AA.

## Business and implementation sources

| Scope                  | Source                                                                               | Role                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |

| Admin shell/navigation | `app/web/src/features/admin/shared/components/AdminShell.tsx`                        | Canonical workspace shell                               |
| Runtime visual system  | `app/web/src/styles/theme.css`, `app/web/src/styles/index.css`, shared UI primitives | Canonical runtime tokens and controls                   |
| Webinar lifecycle      | `app/backend/src/features/webinars/server/webinar.service.ts`                        | Import, storage, playback, subtitle, and retry behavior |
| Zoom recording access  | Standard `/users` and `/users/{userId}/recordings` APIs                              | Account-admin access without master/subaccount APIs     |
| Subtitle versions      | `app/backend/src/features/webinars/server/webinar-subtitle-state.ts`                 | Version registry, lineage, revisions, member tracks     |
| Subtitle AI jobs       | `app/backend/src/features/webinars/server/webinar-subtitle-jobs.service.ts`          | AssemblyAI transcripts, DeepL translations, retries     |
| Member webinar access  | `app/backend/src/features/webinars/server/webinar-access.ts`                         | Canonical publication and member access rule            |

`DESIGN.md` records visual intent. Existing CSS and shared components remain the runtime source of truth; new feature values must follow that mapping rather than introducing a parallel theme.

The Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth app owns these granular admin scopes: `user:read:list_users:admin`, `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings:admin`, and `cloud_recording:read:list_recording_files:admin`. Scope changes require reactivation before the backend requests a new token.

## Canonical UI Map

## Dataset and navigation behavior

- Admin datasets use server pagination. Webinar page size is 20 and filters, committed search, and page are URL-backed.
- Search is debounced by 300 ms, safe during IME composition, and cancels stale requests.
- Loading, empty, no-results, provider-error, retry, range-total, and long-running import states are distinct.
- Tables are semantic and scroll horizontally on narrow viewports without imposing viewport height on the shared shell.
- Navigating away from dirty subtitles requires an app-owned confirmation dialog. Saving stays in the webinar workspace.
- Subtitle versions never overwrite each other: Zoom `SOURCE`, `RU_AI`, `RU_MANUAL`, `EN_AI`, and `EN_MANUAL` live in the webinar record's `subtitle_versions` JSONB with lineage and revision history; cue text is immutable R2 revision objects.
- The workspace navigator reads Source → Russian → English; each language chooses at most one member track. Compare mode aligns same-language versions by timestamp and highlights word-level differences.
- Members see only published, imported webinars their account may watch (`canViewerWatchWebinar`); drafts return 404 and ineligible published webinars return 403 on every member endpoint.

## Async and resilience

| Operation                 | Pending state                                                | Success                                             | Failure and recovery                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sync Zoom                 | Disable Sync Zoom and preserve filters                       | Refresh the first page and announce counts          | Inline error with Retry; previous data remains readable                      |
| Import recording          | Disable the selected webinar action and poll lifecycle state | Webinar becomes Imported and opens in its workspace | Failed state retains a concise provider error and offers deterministic retry |
| Load playback             | Reserve the 16:9 player                                      | Use one temporary private R2 URL                    | Player explains that video is unavailable and allows page refresh            |
| Save subtitles            | Keep editor geometry stable and disable duplicate save       | Append a revision, or create a manual version from Source/AI and select it | A newer revision blocks overwrite; "Reload latest revision" discards local edits |
| Restore revision          | Disable restore controls                                     | Append a restore revision and reload cues           | Nothing is deleted; conflicts ask for a reload                               |
| Generate AI Russian       | Confirm dialog, then a processing version with polling       | New RU_AI version; Source and member track unchanged | Failed/interrupted versions keep the provider error and offer Retry          |
| Translate to English      | Source chosen with radio cards; processing version with progress | New EN_AI version with pinned source lineage     | Failed/interrupted versions keep the error and offer Retry                   |
| Publish / edit access     | Disable submit while saving                                  | Draft ↔ Published, access saved with actor/time     | Validation errors stay inline; publishing never requires subtitles           |

- Imports are pessimistic, atomically claimed in the database, and use deterministic R2 object keys.
- Stale list/search requests are aborted. Detail polling is silent and does not erase local edits.
- Browser playback and subtitle requests are lazy; list rows never create signed playback URLs.
- Admin session expiry follows the shared authentication behavior; server endpoints independently require admin access.

## Components and accessibility

- Shared Button, Input, Dialog, Select, Table, status, empty-state, and page-shell owners are reused.
- Enabled actions have pointer, hover, focus-visible, active, disabled, busy, and error states without changing layout.
- Player controls expose text labels, pressed state where applicable, and keyboard-operable native range inputs.
- Subtitle cues are timestamped, searchable, editable, seekable, and visibly active without relying on color alone.
- Dialogs trap focus, support Escape, restore focus, and provide a title and description.
- Nonessential motion is disabled under reduced-motion preferences; forced-colors retains operable scrollbars and controls.

## Responsive behavior

- `AdminShell` owns the sidebar-to-drawer transformation.
- Filters wrap into a compact grid; the recording table owns horizontal overflow.
- The detail editor uses a wide main column and narrower metadata rail, stacking on smaller screens.
- The 16:9 player reserves media geometry before its signed source is ready.

## Verification contract

- Static: backend TypeScript build and lint; web typecheck, targeted lint, tests, production build, and premium audit.
- Browser: Chrome desktop plus narrow-viewport checks of list overflow, dialogs, player controls, cue seeking, and dirty-state navigation.
- Integration: authenticated admin session, Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth app, private R2 bucket with playback CORS, and migrated PostgreSQL schema.
- Failure paths: malformed dates, missing MP4/transcript, Zoom/R2 failures, duplicate import, stale import recovery, invalid VTT, and ETag conflict.

## Dashboard commerce and notifications

The Sales and Notifications feature scope follows the implementation request recorded in `docs/SALES-AND-NOTIFICATIONS.md`; server rules are owned by `features/sales/server`, `features/notifications/server/dashboard-notifications.ts`, and migrations `0021`–`0022` in the backend.

- The existing admin shell and dashboard tab shell own navigation. Sales and Notifications have dedicated, restorable dashboard routes; details use stable IDs in query parameters.
- Shared Radix Dialog/Popover/Select primitives own focus, Escape, and outside-click behavior. Commerce inputs use existing `border` and `input-background` tokens so portal content remains visible. Native `datetime-local` controls follow the browser locale and store UTC instants.
- `SalePurchaseProvider` owns details, confirmation, Checkout, and verified return states for catalog, notification, and event entry points. Payment return feedback takes priority over automatic detail dialogs, then restores the source context.
- `NotificationProvider` owns the header feed, unread badge, read acknowledgement, and receipt-backed incoming toasts. Opening details marks the notification read; full-list filters and direct links use the same provider.
- Sale edits preserve immutable order snapshots and use optimistic versions. Archive is reversible publication control, not record deletion. An interrupted checkout resumes its reserved order; a sold-out item remains resumable by the account holding that reservation.
- UI copy uses the existing locale provider with EN/RU/UK commerce dictionaries. Admin-authored translations are optional and fall back to the default content. Existing English mailing audience controls retain their established admin behavior.
- Publication and payment mutations show loading, errors, retry, and completion. Sale editor dismissal warns about unsaved changes. Notification composition warns on page unload. All read and payment authorization is checked by the backend.
